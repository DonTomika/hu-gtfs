A small framework for creating GTFS timetables using OpenStreetMap
geographic data.

Parts:

./bin/hugtfs.pl
	A CLI interface to the various features supported by hu-gtfs:
	* downloading agency data
	* parsing agency data
	* outputting gtfs
	* merging feeds
	* importing feeds into a PostgreSQL/PostGIS db
	* "deploying" feeds (used for data.flaktack.net/transit)
	* creating a KML of stops in a feed, with route stop there
	* creating an SVG of trips in a feed

./mav - M√ÅV-START Zrt.
	National Train Company
	Downloads data from elvira.mav-start.hu, then parses it to create
	a GTFS feed.
	Support using platform & railway track data from OSM.

./bkv
	Downloas GTFS data & replaces stop/shape data with the same from
	OSM.

./volanbusz
./kisvasut_gyermekvasut
	Downloads timetables & parses them creating partial GTFS data,
	which then is paired with OSM data using HuGTFS::OSMMerger.

./kompok
	Creates GTFS from OSM route=ferry ways & hard coded timetables.

./lib/HuGTFS/FeedManager/*
	An assortment of "FeedManagers" which download & parse/create
	agency data into partial GTFS data.

./lib/Cal.pm
	Various utility methods for working with services

./lib/HuGTFS/Crawler.pm
	Simple crawler for downloading transit agency data.

./lib/HuGTFS/Dumper.pm
	Code to dump perl objects into a gtfs feed.

./lib/HuGTFS/KML.pm
./lib/HuGTFS/SVG.pm
	Code to create KML/SVG files of feeds

./lib/HuGTFS/OSMMerger.pm
	Code to extract route data from OSM, and then merge it with
	the available GTFS data.
	Currently only parses data from the older, Hungarian only
	line_variant relations:
	http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Hungary/T%C3%B6megk%C3%B6zleked%C3%A9s
	But can easily be modified to use proposed, newer route_variant
	relations:

./lib/HuGTFS/Util.pm
	Random utility methods.
	
./util/db-schema.sql
	The DB schema used by the WFS & hugtfs.pl DB importer.
